Build a green science pack factory with a throughput of at least 60/m, using red belts and inserters.

### Message 2

I cannot currently access blueprints in the database. Instead, I will help you design a green science pack factory with a throughput of at least 60 per minute using red belts and inserters.

To make green science packs at 60 per minute:
- Each green science pack takes 6 seconds to craft in an assembly machine 1.
- Crafting speed of assembly machine 1 is 0.5, so effective crafting time is 12 seconds per pack.
- To achieve 60 packs per minute (1 per second), you need 12 assembly machine 1s working simultaneously, because 12 machines × 0.5 crafting speed results in 6 seconds per pack per machine.

Ingredients for green science packs (per pack):
- Inserter x1
- Transport belt x1

Both inserters and transport belts require iron plates and gears:
- Inserter requires: Iron plates x1, Iron gear wheels x1
- Transport belt requires: Iron plates x1, Iron gear wheels x1
- Iron gear wheels require iron plates (2 iron plates per gear wheel)

So building a green science factory at 60 packs/min requires:
- 12 assembly machines making green science packs
- Inserters and transport belts supplied at 60/min too
- Assembly machines making inserters and transport belts at a matching rate
- Assembly machines making iron gear wheels at matching rate
- Iron furnaces smelting enough iron plates

Belts should be red belts (transporting 30 items/second), so a single red belt can easily handle the throughput.

I will now provide a simple blueprint layout plan for this factory using red belts and inserters.
Here is a simple factory design outline you can build in Factorio for 60 green science packs per minute with red belts and inserters:

1. Green Science Assembly (x12 machines):
- Each makes 1 science pack in 6s (crafting speed 0.5 = 12s per pack)
- 12 machines allow 1 pack/s = 60/min

2. Inserters and Transport Belts Production:
- Both need Iron plates and Iron gear wheels
- Each inserter and belt takes ~0.5s crafting time with crafting speed 0.5
- You need 60 inserters/min and 60 belts/min
- So allocate at least 1 assembly machine each for inserters and belts (better with 2 each for buffer)

3. Iron Gear Wheel Production:
- Each gear wheel requires 2 iron plates
- You need 60 inserters + 60 belts → 120 gear wheels per minute
- Each gear wheel takes 0.5s with crafting speed 0.5 (1s effective)
- You need ~2 assembly machines making gears

4. Iron Plate Smelting:
- Smelt iron ore in stone furnaces (or steel furnaces with higher speed)
- Iron plate consumption: gears = 240 plates/min (120 gears * 2 plates)
  + inserters = 60 plates
  + belts = 60 plates
  + green science packs have no direct iron plate use except through inserters/belts
- Total plates needed ~360 per minute (6 plates per second)
- 6 stone furnaces can produce about sufficient iron plates (each stone furnace produces 1 plate per ~3.5s)

5. Belt Layout:
- Use Red belts (capacity 30 items/s) to feed materials to assembler machines
- Inserters to load/unload assemblers
- Use one belt line for iron plates, one for gears, split belts feeding assemblers

This setup will reach 60 green science packs per minute with red belts and inserters only.

If you want, I can generate a detailed step-by-step blueprint for you. Would you like me to do so?
